## üìù Notebook Summaries

### 1. Driver Behavior Analysis (`driver_behavior_analysis.ipynb`)

**Objective:** Profile driver behavior using acceleration patterns and telemetry signals.

**Key Steps:**

* Decoding `accData` into x, y, z components.
* Feature extraction from acceleration sequences.
* Clustering techniques to identify driving styles (aggressive, smooth, erratic).
* Visualizations of acceleration signals and driver clusters.
* LSTM-based sequential modeling to capture temporal driving patterns.

**Outcomes:**

* Classification of drivers into behavioral clusters.
* Insights into risky vs. efficient driving.
* Identification of improvement areas for fleet safety.

### 2. Predictive Maintenance (`EV_Predictive_Analysis.ipynb`)

**Objective:** Forecast potential EV component failures to reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

**Key Steps:**

* Feature engineering from telemetry and usage data.
* Temporal aggregation of sensor data into trip-level statistics.
* Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) for predictive maintenance.
* Evaluating model performance on failure prediction.
* Interpreting important features contributing to maintenance needs.

**Outcomes:**

* Predictive insights into battery health, motor stress, and system wear.
* Early detection of anomalies leading to breakdowns.
* Actionable maintenance recommendations for fleet operators.
